Java 8
======================================
1) Java Method References

https://www.javatpoint.com/java-8-method-reference

Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of lambda expression. Each time when you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference. In this tutorial, we are explaining method reference concept in detail.
Types of Method References

There are following types of method references in java:

    Reference to a static method.
    Reference to an instance method.
    Reference to a constructor.
---------------------------------------
	
ContainingClass::staticMethodName => 

// Referring static method  
        Sayable sayable = MethodReference::saySomething;  
		
----------------------------------------------

containingObject::instanceMethodName  

      // Referring non-static method using reference  
            Sayable sayable = methodReference::saySomething;  
			
-------------------------------------------------

    ClassName::new  
	
	//Reference to a constructor.
	Messageable hello = Message::new;  
	hello.getMessage("Hello");  


2) We use the min() and max() methods to find the min & max value in streams. These methods are used for finding min & max values in different types of streams such as stream of chars, strings, dates etc. We just have to change the parameter that we pass in this method based on the type of stream.

https://beginnersbook.com/2019/02/java-8-stream-min-and-max/

List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(-9, -18, 0, 25, 4);
list.stream().min(Integer::compare).get();

List<String> slist=Arrays.asList("agy","Byf","yt","Aytf","cytf","zytf");
slist.stream().max(Comparator.comparing(String::valueOf)).get();

slist.stream().anyMatch(k -> k.startsWith("a"));

Stream<String> st=slist.stream().map(String::toUpperCase);
System.out.println(st.collect(Collectors.toList()));

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duplicate entries in the list

List<Integer> list= Arrays.asList(2,3,4,1,5,6,3,5);
		
Set<Integer> set=new HashSet<Integer>();
		
System.out.println(list.stream().filter(n -> !set.add(n)).collect(Collectors.toList()));

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) what is the difference between list.add and list.set
set replaces the element at the given index. add inserts the element at the given index and moves all elements ahead of it one position.

4) what does Collection.retainAll(Collection<?> c) do?
Removes the element at the specified position in this list (optionaloperation). Shifts any subsequent elements to the left (subtracts onefrom their indices). Returns the element that was removed from thelist.

5) what does distinct() do?
slist.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList())

6) what are the Stream features?

Stream provides following features:

    Stream does not store elements. It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
    Stream is functional in nature. Operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source. For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.
    Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
    The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.

You can use stream to filter, collect, print, and convert from one data structure to other etc. In the following examples, we have apply various operations with the help of stream.

===============================================================================================================================================================

						Methods																		Description
						
boolean allMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)	::::::::::	It returns all elements of this stream which match the provided predicate. If the stream is 
empty then true is returned and the predicate is not evaluated.

boolean anyMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)	::::::::::	It returns any element of this stream that matches the provided predicate. If the stream is empty then false is returned and the predicate is not evaluated.

static <T> Stream.Builder<T> builder()	::::::::::	It returns a builder for a Stream.

<R,A> R collect(Collector<? super T,A,R> collector)	::::::::::	It performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream using a Collector. A Collector encapsulates the functions used as arguments to collect(Supplier, BiConsumer, BiConsumer), allowing for reuse of collection strategies and composition of collect operations such as multiple-level grouping or partitioning.

<R> R collect(Supplier<R> supplier, BiConsumer<R,? super T> accumulator, BiConsumer<R,R> combiner)	::::::::::	It performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream. A mutable reduction is one in which the reduced value is a mutable result container, such as an ArrayList, and elements are incorporated by updating the state of the result rather than by replacing the result.

static <T> Stream<T> concat(Stream<? extends T> a, Stream<? extends T> b)	::::::::::	It creates a lazily concatenated stream whose elements are all the elements of the first stream followed by all the elements of the second stream. The resulting stream is ordered if both of the input streams are ordered, and parallel if either of the input streams is parallel. When the resulting stream is closed, the close handlers for both input streams are invoked.

long count()	::::::::::	It returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction.

Stream<T> distinct()	::::::::::	It returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to Object.equals(Object)) of this stream.

static <T> Stream<T> empty()	::::::::::	It returns an empty sequential Stream.

Stream<T> filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)	::::::::::	It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate.

Optional<T> findAny()	::::::::::	It returns an Optional describing some element of the stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty.

Optional<T> findFirst()	::::::::::	It returns an Optional describing the first element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. If the stream has no encounter order, then any element may be returned.

<R> Stream<R> flatMap(Function<? super T,? extends Stream<? extends R>> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.)

DoubleStream flatMapToDouble(Function<? super T,? extends DoubleStream> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns a DoubleStream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have placed been into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.)

IntStream flatMapToInt(Function<? super T,? extends IntStream> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns an IntStream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.)

LongStream flatMapToLong(Function<? super T,? extends LongStream> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns a LongStream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.)

void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action)	::::::::::	It performs an action for each element of this stream.

void forEachOrdered(Consumer<? super T> action)	::::::::::	It performs an action for each element of this stream, in the encounter order of the stream if the stream has a defined encounter order.

static <T> Stream<T> generate(Supplier<T> s)	::::::::::	It returns an infinite sequential unordered stream where each element is generated by the provided Supplier. This is suitable for generating constant streams, streams of random elements, etc.

static <T> Stream<T> iterate(T seed,UnaryOperator<T> f)	::::::::::	It returns an infinite sequential ordered Stream produced by iterative application of a function f to an initial element seed, producing a Stream consisting of seed, f(seed), f(f(seed)), etc.

Stream<T> limit(long maxSize)	::::::::::	It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, truncated to be no longer than maxSize in length.

<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T,? extends R> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.

DoubleStream mapToDouble(ToDoubleFunction<? super T> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns a DoubleStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.

IntStream mapToInt(ToIntFunction<? super T> mapper)	::::::::::	It returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.

static <T> Stream<T> of(T t)	::::::::::	It returns a sequential Stream containing a single element.

Stream<T> peek(Consumer<? super T> action)	::::::::::	It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, additionally performing the provided action on each element as elements are consumed from the resulting stream.

Optional<T> reduce(BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)	::::::::::	It performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using an associative accumulation function, and returns an Optional describing the reduced value, if any.

T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)	::::::::::	It performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using the provided identity value and an associative accumulation function, and returns the reduced value.
